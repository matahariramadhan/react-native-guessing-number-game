# react-native-guessing-number-game
This is another simple project that beginner can practice to learn react native, where the player can input preferred number and the computer guess that number. User press lower if the computer's guess number is lower than his number, and vice versa.
There is no complex styling here that can make beginner overwhelmed, just a few styling and basic logic to practice react/javascript.
